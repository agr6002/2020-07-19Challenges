        Say you have an array for which the <i>i</i>th element is the price of a
        given stock on day <i>i</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e.,
        buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find
        the maximum profit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
      </p>
      <h3>Example 1:</h3>
      <p>Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]</p>
      <p>Output: 5</p>
      <p>
        Why? Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit =
        6-1 = 5. Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying
        price.
      </p>
      <h3>Example 2:</h3>
      <p>Input: [7,6,4,3,1]</p>
      <p>Output: 0</p>
      <p>Why? In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.</p>
